📚 Job Posting Duration Analysis: A Web Scraping and Data Analytics Project
🧠 Project Overview
Have you ever scoured job boards to apply for countless job openings only to find the same post after a month or two? I have always wondered why companies are having a hard time finding a suitable candidate for their positions. This project investigates why some data-related job postings (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Analyst roles) remain open for extended periods. Using web scraping and data analysis, the goal is to uncover trends and insights about posting longevity and help fellow job-hunters in traversing the current recruitment landscape for data roles.

🎯 Objectives
Scrape job posting data (title, company, location, posting date) for data-related roles from Indeed.com and Jobstreet.com.

Calculate Days Open for each listing and amount of reposts.

Analyze patterns in job duration based on skills, industries, and locations.

Visualize insights to understand hiring market challenges for tech/data roles.
