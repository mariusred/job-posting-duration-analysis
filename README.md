📚 Job Posting Duration Analysis: A Web Scraping and Data Analytics Project


🧠 Project Overview

Have you ever scoured job boards to apply for countless job openings only to find the same post after a month or two? I have always wondered why companies are having a hard time finding a suitable candidate for their positions and so I wanted to see how job posts look. This project investigates why some data-related job postings (e.g., Data Scientist, Data Analyst roles) remain open for extended periods and recur in job sites. Using web scraping and data analysis, the goal is to uncover trends and insights about posting longevity and help fellow job-hunters in traversing the current recruitment landscape for data roles.
